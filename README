Configuration management
========================

Which inventory to use
----------------------



How to remove a user's key
--------------------------

Do not remove a user's SSH key by deleting its item from the list. This
will simply stop Ansible from managing this key and would leave it
present on the CA server. Rather, add the "state:" key with the value
"absent". Then run the next install.yml playbook run will actually
remove the SSH key from the user's authorized_keys file.


How to create SSH keypairs for the ssh_ca_keypairs variable
-----------------------------------------------------------

On your workstation, use ssh-keygen to generate a keypair.

  ssh-keygen -C iweb-sc-01 -f iweb-sc-01

  -C iweb-sc-01
      Set the key's comment to "iweb-sc-01".
      By convention, 01 is the key's sequence number. Thus you can provision multiple
      keys in advance to facilitate key rotation.
  -f
      Provide the output filename. The public part will have .pub appended to the name.

Then copy the content of the files to the secret and public keys of a new list item.
